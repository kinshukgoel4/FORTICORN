*The Problem🚩🚩*:
In recent times, Fire🔥🔥 accidents are major disasters. Fire🔥🔥 accidents cause a major damage to human life.To decrease the damage caused due to fire🔥🔥 accidents we come up with the Image processing Technology.This project can be implemented in any crowded places.In the current scenario, fire🔥🔥 outbreak is common issue happening these days all over the world and the damage caused by this type of incidents is tremendous toward nature and causing loss to the human life.As per the research report given by Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India (ADSI), it was stated as fire🔥🔥 related accidents have killed 35 people every day on an average in the last six years between 2016 and 2021. To overcome this issue, we have come up with a safe and cost effective model. Though there are existing technologies for the fire🔥🔥 detection, our proposed system can be deployed easily in the existing cameras like CCTV which makes it portable and reliable. As there are no hardware components involved in this model, hence it is cost-effective and will be much efficient in nature.

The Team approach🙌🙌:
In this we are using image processing techniques which is compatible in surveillance devices like CCTV,wireless camera to UAVs. It can be mostly used in Railway stations, crowded places like markets, bus stations, since the cameras are already installed in such places and this system is aimed at diminishing the disadvantages of false alarm which makes the system cost effective, efficient and a fast method for detecting fire🔥🔥. Coming to the working model, whenever the fire🔥🔥 is detected it sends a message to nearby fire🔥🔥 stations and to the concerned departments with a beep or alarm sound at the place where the fire🔥🔥 outbreak has occurred.

Specifications✨:
• Can expect accurate output
• Improving technology
• Autonomous

Introduction😵😵:
In this we are using image processing techniques which is compatible in surveillance devices like CCTV, wireless camera to UAVs. It can be mostly used in Railway stations, crowded places like markets, bus stations, since the cameras are already installed in such places and this system is aimed at diminishing the disadvantages of false alarm which makes the system cost effective, efficient and a fast method for detecting fire🔥🔥. Coming to the working model, whenever the fire🔥🔥 is detected it sends a 
message to nearby fire🔥🔥 stations and to the concerned departments with a beep or alarm sound at the place where the fire🔥🔥 outbreak has occurred.

Libraries used📚📚:
• NumPy
• OpenCv
• SMTP 
• Playsound
• Threading

Future Enhancements🔮:
We can develop this project in more modern way by using different paths. We can redevelop this project by using temperature sensors and capturing 
the exact position of fire🔥🔥 and in many ways. There is much more way to develop this and make this more useful in the future.

Alternate Methods🗝️🗝️:
1)By using Y Cb Cr
2)Cyan Magenta Yellow Key(CMYK)
3)Convolutional Neural Networks
4)Thermal Detection System
5)CIE L*a*b* color space


Conclusion:
This project will be more helpful in public areas because in this busy world everyone is scheduled in their own work and not caring about the 
surrounding until there is effect. This problem can be with help of our project regarding fire🔥🔥 problems.
